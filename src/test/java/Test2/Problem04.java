/*Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days. 
 * The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one 
 * transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8*/
